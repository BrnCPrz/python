# Reordering a pedigree by *Kahn's* algorithm
 This script is an adaptation of the reord/renum function in __PedWorks.py__ ([more](https://github.com/BrnCPrz/PedWorks)) program. It has the objective of presenting a new method to reorder a pedigree using a network theory framework. 
 
 The Kahn's algorithm (Kahn, 1962) for network topological sorting performs a linear ordering of its vertices such that for every edge [x,y] connecting vertices x and y, x will come before y in the final ordering. When applied to genealogical structured data (or simply pedigrees!), edge connections [x,y] may be interpreted as the parent-child relationship, where the parent is represented by x and progeny by y. This brings the perception that when applying the algorithm, x (parents) will always come before their progeny (y) in the final ordering.
